# Corealis

Minimal Rails application for managing web based programming interviews,
powered by ActiveAdmin, Opal and Ruby.

# Setting up development environment

- PostgreSQL is the only supported database (Default settings work out of the box with [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/))
- For mails it is expected that a local SMTP server is available at `smtp://127.0.0.1:1025` (This works out of the box with mailcatcher)
